## 📖 Advice from Your Senior

### 🚫 Procrastination is a Beast
This isn't high school anymore; assignments won’t wait. Procrastination is the enemy, and it’s hungry. Do your work early or get ready for painful all-nighters.  
👉 *Pain of Discipline > Pain of Regret.*  

### 👨‍🏫 Professors are not Mind Readers
If you’re struggling, **speak up**. Professors can’t help if they don’t know.  

### 🌐 The Internet is a Double-Edged Sword
Use it wisely—study resources > memes.  
Don’t ChatGPT everything; learn the concepts.  

### 🎮 Exams are the Final Bosses
Both **Mids & Finals** matter. Prepare like you’re facing the end-game boss.  

### ✨ Don’t Skip the Side Quests
Join clubs, attend events, explore extracurriculars. They give you real-life XP.
