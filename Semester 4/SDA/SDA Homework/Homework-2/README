Weather Monitoring System


Overview
This project implements the Observer Pattern to create a weather monitoring system. It consists of the following components:

Subject (WeatherData): Maintains weather data and notifies observers of changes.

Observers (CurrentConditionsDisplay, StatisticsDisplay, ForecastDisplay): Displays different types of weather-related data when updated.

DisplayElement Interface: Defines a method for displaying data.

Execution Steps


1. Setup and Compilation
Compiled it using Termminal. Compile the Java files using:
javac *.java

2. Run the Application
Execute the main class that initializes the WeatherData and display components:
java WeatherStation

3. Expected Output
Once the program runs, it will display weather updates for Current Conditions, Statistics, and Forecast based on changing data.

4. Modify Weather Data
To simulate weather changes, modify setMeasurements(float temperature, float humidity, float pressure) in WeatherData and observe how displays update.
